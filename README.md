## Purpose

This project user-item interaction data to create four types of recommendation engines. The user-item interaction data is from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

There four types of recommenders are:

1.	Rank Based Recommendations
2.	User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
3.	Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED) - Completion TBD
4.  Matrix Factorization


The recommenders are created through a series of functions and are used to help answer different questions.
